This is an evalution metric that measures the ratio of concordant to discordant pairs, used in classification problems. It is used for seeing whether 2 data points match or not.

This metric is used in another metric called Kendall Tau's Rank Correlation Coefficient which we will see later on.

Let us understand this with an example.

## Example
